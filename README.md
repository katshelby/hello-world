Hello World!

I wanted to learn how to program, so I have started a new GitHub. I live in Sweden, but my parents are from Finland and the USA. I study management and organisation inside the major of Sociology. I want to become a manager one day. Developing new skills is important to reach new career goals, plus I have developed a new interest for this stuff.

This is cool.

Best regards,
Kat Shelby
